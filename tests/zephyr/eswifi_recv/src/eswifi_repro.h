/* eswifi_repro.h
 *
 * Copied byte-for-byte from C-MSP's
 * tests/drivers/eswifi_recv/src/eswifi_repro.h for docs/planning.md
 * step 4 (re-run the CVE-2026-1679 proof against the new portable
 * core+adapter). Deliberately not touched: this file only calls
 * fault_inject.h's public API, which is unchanged between C-MSP's
 * Zephyr-only core and this repo's portable one, so an unmodified copy
 * is the correct way to prove the generalization didn't weaken the
 * proof. If this ever needs to diverge from C-MSP's version, that's a
 * decision to make deliberately, not a drift to let happen silently.
 *
 * A small, simplified reconstruction of the bug pattern behind
 * CVE-2026-1679 (Zephyr eswifi socket offload driver buffer overflow):
 * a driver copies a payload into a fixed-size buffer without first
 * checking that the payload actually fits.
 *
 * Here the payload length is not attacker-supplied over a socket -- it's
 * a length reported by a hardware/firmware call (eswifi_hw_read_length),
 * which the driver trusts. In real hardware you cannot easily make the
 * device report a bogus oversized length on demand; that's exactly the
 * kind of hard-to-reach external condition a fault point exists to
 * manufacture in a test.
 *
 * Two implementations of the same function signature are provided in
 * separate translation units (eswifi_repro_buggy.c / eswifi_repro_fixed.c)
 * so the identical test file can be linked against either one.
